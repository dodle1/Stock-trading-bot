# Stock-trading-bot
A beginner stock trading AI. Uses ML Finbert as the ai while using some parts of lumibot api. 

1. Install lumibot timedelta alpaca-trade-api==3.1.1 into a coda enviorment.

2. Install torch torchvision torchaudio transformers.

3. Update the API keys and secret to yours in order to connect to Alpaca for paper trading.

4. Update the Dates as well as any period you are trying to use it. 


(The Different route is an interesting adaption of the other code focusing on bracket trading working differently on the first two trades.)
